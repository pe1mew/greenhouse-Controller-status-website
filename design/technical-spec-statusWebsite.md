| Companion | `functional-design.md` — *what* the system does (kept with the website, not in this repository) |
| Version | 2.0 |
| Date | 2026-09-25 |
| Status | For implementation — covers firmware **up to 2.14.0**. Every field below was read from the emitter, `firmware/src/status_post/status_json.cpp::build_canonical_status_json()`, and dated with `git log -S`; the last payload change is 2.13.0 (2.14.0 changes no payload field) |

This document is the implementation brief. It describes file layout, configuration constants, endpoint code paths, storage recipes, frontend wiring, and verification steps. The functional rules it implements are defined in [functional-design.md](functional-design.md); read that first.

**What changed in 2.0** (covers firmware 2.0.0 through 2.14.0 — 1.0 had stopped at 2.0.0-a.6.35.7, so this revision is three months of firmware):

- **A new window state, `PART_OPEN` (2.12.0).** In linear control M3 can stop part-way. A site built on 1.0 draws it with the `UNKNOWN` grey (its colour table has no entry and falls back), so a working part-open window looks like a fault. §3.4 and §10 now define it. **This is the one change that affects what a 1.0 site shows.**
- **Six new `mode.flags[]` strings**, which a 1.0 site silently drops (unknown flags are skipped by design): `standby`, `rota_update_pending`, `sensor_fault_position`, `m3_not_confirmed`, `m3_travel_short`, `m3_travel_long`. The public dashboard shows no badge today for STANDBY, a pending update or a position-sensor fault. §9.4 now lists all sixteen, with the same colours and labels as the controller's own GUI.
- **M3's position and control law in `windows`**: `M3_percent_x10`, `M3_mm_x10`, `M3_at_end_sensor` (2.7.1, only when a position sensor is fitted and trusted), `M3_ctrl_mode` (2.12.0), `M3_ctrl_reason` and `M3_pos_gate` (2.13.0).
- **`system` gained SD and heap fields**: `sd_mounted`, `sd_free_mb`, `sd_size_mb` (2.0.2), `heap_free_kb`, `heap_min_kb` (2.2.5), `heap_largest_kb` (2.2.10).
- **A new top-level `bus` array** (2.8.0) of per-slave Modbus counters, gated by the `system` bit but **outside** the `system` object.
- **§3.3 log upload corrected in three places.** Files have rotated at **1 MB since 2.1.2**, not 512 KB — and a rotated file overshoots by the last row (up to 1 048 618 bytes seen), so **the old advice of `GH_LOG_MAX_BYTES` = 1 MB would reject almost every file**. Both live sites accept them (checked 2026-09-25: all 34 files on the production site and 100 on the development site are ≥ 1 MB), so their limits are already higher; a new deployment following 1.0 would not be. Filenames carry the unit ID (`2344_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.csv`), and since 2.12.2 a controller uploads only its own files, newest after the last one by timestamp.
- **The field-stability guarantee is widened** to cover what bit 1.0: a new *value* of an existing field (`PART_OPEN`) is as much a change as a new field, so consumers must tolerate unknown values, not only unknown keys.
- **New testable requirements** TR-49..TR-56 (§15.11).

**What changed in 1.0** (covers firmware 2.0.0-a.6.32 through 2.0.0-a.6.35.7):

- **New §3.4 — Canonical JSON shape**. The full schema of the payload `api.php` receives is now documented field-by-field. `status_post/status_json.cpp` in the firmware is the single source of truth; this section mirrors that contract so the implementer doesn't have to read C++ to know what arrives.
- **New §9.4 — Mode tile badge rendering (`mode.flags[]`)**. The firmware emits an array of flag strings inside `mode.flags`; each maps to a coloured badge inside the mode tile. The full `FLAG_CLASS` table (11 flag strings since a.6.35.6) lives here with the colour-class assignments so the dashboard renders badges consistently with the local web GUI.
- **§3.1 — HTTPS-only delivery**. The firmware's `/api/web` validator now rejects `http://` URLs (a.6.35 item G), so server-side delivery is guaranteed HTTPS. The spec calls this out as part of the operator contract.
- **§3.3 — Log uploads**. Updated to reflect the firmware's streaming-chunk upload pattern (`esp_http_client_open` + 4 KB `esp_http_client_write` loop) and the `?action=log&file=<name>` query-string carrying the original SD filename. Server-side filename policy unchanged (server time wins; client filename is discarded).
- **§15 — New testable requirements**: TR-43..TR-48 covering canonical-JSON shape, mode.flags badge rendering, and the HTTPS-only contract.

The reference examples in `documentation/webguiExample/` and `documentation/phpAPIExample/` are followed closely; pull patterns from there before writing new ones.

Notes:

- **Apache's `DocumentRoot` (or virtual host root) must be set to `httproot/`.** Nothing outside `httproot/` is served — `mock/`, `design/`, `tools/`, and `documentation/` stay private even on a misconfigured host.
- `httproot/data/` is never reachable over HTTP (its `.htaccess` denies all). Only `view.php` reads from it.
- `httproot/log/logs/` is served directly by Apache for downloads.
- `httproot/log/index.php` is a separate, unlinked page that lists log files. It server-renders the list — no JS, no fetch.
- `config.php` defines constants only. It is **gitignored** so the production secret never enters the repo. A tracked template, `config_template.php`, is the canonical source for first-time setup. PHP processes `config.php` to no output, so even a direct `GET` returns 0 bytes.
- The two API files are deliberately split. `api.php` rejects GET; `view.php` rejects POST.

---

## 2. Configuration

Two files at `httproot/`:

- **`config_template.php`** — tracked in git, holds placeholder values, includes a banner comment that explains the first-time-setup procedure. Production secrets never appear here.
- **`config.php`** — gitignored. Created by copying the template and editing `GH_SECRET_TOKEN` to a real random value. Both `api.php` and `view.php` `require __DIR__ . '/config.php'`.

The deploy script (`tools/deploy.ps1`) runs a pre-flight check: it refuses
to deploy if `config.php` is missing or still contains the
`REPLACE_ME_BEFORE_DEPLOY` template marker, and prints a non-fatal warning
if the older fallback `dev-…` placeholder is still in place (acceptable
on a LAN test server).

The constants the file must define:

```php
<?php
define('GH_SECRET_TOKEN',        '<long random string, identical on controller>');
define('GH_DEBUG_RESPONSES',     false);

define('GH_DATA_DIR',            __DIR__ . '/data');
define('GH_STATUS_FILE',         GH_DATA_DIR . '/status.json');

define('GH_LOG_DIR',             __DIR__ . '/log/logs');
define('GH_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS',  90);
define('GH_LOG_MAX_BYTES',       5 * 1024 * 1024);
define('GH_LOG_ALLOWED_EXT',     ['log', 'txt']);

define('GH_POLL_INTERVAL_MS',    5000);
define('GH_DEFAULT_INTERVAL_S',  30);

define('GH_WINDOW_NAMES', [
    'M1' => 'South roof',
    'M2' => 'North roof',
    'M3' => 'North wall',
]);
```

Rotation: change `GH_SECRET_TOKEN` here and the corresponding compiled value on the controller, then redeploy both. There is no runtime rotation.

## 3. Backend — controller ingest API (`api.php`)

Accepts only `POST`. Dispatches by `$_GET['action']` (default action = status).

### 3.1 Common entry checks (in order)

1. `if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] !== 'POST')` → silent 204 (or `405 {"error":"method_not_allowed"}` in debug). Exit.
2. `if (($_SERVER['HTTP_SOURCEIDENTIFIER'] ?? '') !== GH_SECRET_TOKEN)` → silent 204 (or `401 {"error":"unauthorized"}` in debug). Exit.

**HTTPS-only delivery (firmware 2.0.0-a.6.35+).** The controller's `POST /api/web` validator rejects any `status_url` that doesn't start with `https://` (see firmware `web_server.cpp::web_post_handler`). An operator cannot configure a plain-HTTP endpoint via the controller's GUI. The server should also enforce HTTPS at the Apache layer — e.g., via `RewriteRule` that 301-redirects `http://` → `https://`, or with `Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000"` plus port 80 disabled — so a misconfigured controller (e.g., reverting to an older firmware that still allows http) doesn't leak the shared secret on the wire. The `sourceidentifier` header contains the secret token; over plain HTTP it would be visible to any on-path observer.

### 3.2 Push status (no `action` query parameter)

After the common checks:

```php
try {
    $body = file_get_contents('php://input');
    $payload = json_decode($body, true, 512, JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR);
    if (!is_array($payload)) throw new RuntimeException('not an object');
} catch (Throwable $e) {
    if (GH_DEBUG_RESPONSES) {
        http_response_code(400);
        header('Content-Type: application/json');
        echo json_encode(['error' => 'bad_json', 'detail' => $e->getMessage()]);
    } else {
        http_response_code(204);
    }
    exit;
}

$payload['received_at'] = time();

$tmp = GH_STATUS_FILE . '.tmp';
file_put_contents($tmp, json_encode($payload), LOCK_EX);
rename($tmp, GH_STATUS_FILE);

if (GH_DEBUG_RESPONSES) {
    header('Content-Type: application/json');
    echo json_encode(['ok' => true, 'received_at' => $payload['received_at']]);
} else {
    http_response_code(204);
}
```

### 3.3 Upload log (`?action=log&file=<sd-filename>`)

The firmware sends CSV log files via a **streaming chunked POST** rather than loading the whole file into RAM and POSTing in one shot. Behaviour (firmware reference: `firmware/src/status_post/status_post.cpp::do_log_upload`):

- URL: `<status_url>?action=log&file=<sd-filename>`. The `file` query parameter carries the original SD filename for the server's traceability. Since firmware 2.0.x (gh#30) it starts with the controller's 4-hex unit ID: `2344_20260519031514.csv` (`<unit_id>_<local creation time YYYYMMDDHHMMSS>.csv`). Server-side filename policy unchanged — the server still **discards** the client-supplied name and generates one from server time (TR-05). The `file` parameter is purely diagnostic, available via `$_GET['file']` if the server wants to log it.
- Content-Type: `text/csv`. Body is the raw CSV bytes — same format as a `/api/log/download` from the controller.
- Content-Length: announced up-front so the server can validate against `GH_LOG_MAX_BYTES` before reading the body (TR-06).
- Streaming: the firmware calls `esp_http_client_open(client, file_size)` then writes the file in 4 KB chunks via `esp_http_client_write`. PHP's `file_get_contents('php://input')` reads the assembled body transparently, so no PHP-side change vs. a single-shot upload. The streaming pattern bounds the firmware's per-write mbedTLS heap demand regardless of total file size (gh#23 shape).
- `sourceidentifier` header carries the shared secret (same header used by the status POST).
- Multi-file drain (a.6.35.2, corrected in 2.12.2): after the controller successfully uploads file *X*, it persists `cfg.log_last_up = X` in NVS. The next trigger (daily slot or rotation) uploads every **closed** file of **this controller** whose creation time is **later** than X's, oldest first. Two things changed in 2.12.2 (gh#82): the comparison is on the **timestamp** in the name, not the whole name — once names carry a unit prefix, `FDA4_…` sorts after every `2344_…` and a name comparison would stop the drain for good — and files of **another** controller on the same card (a development rig swaps modules) are never uploaded. The file the controller is still writing is never sent.

PHP code:

```php
$len = (int) ($_SERVER['CONTENT_LENGTH'] ?? 0);
if ($len <= 0 || $len > GH_LOG_MAX_BYTES) {
    if (GH_DEBUG_RESPONSES) {
        http_response_code(413);
        header('Content-Type: application/json');
        echo json_encode(['error' => 'too_large_or_empty', 'bytes' => $len]);
    } else {
        http_response_code(204);
    }
    exit;
}

$body = file_get_contents('php://input');
$name = date('Y-m-d_His') . '.log';
$path = GH_LOG_DIR . '/' . $name;
file_put_contents($path, $body, LOCK_EX);
chmod($path, 0644);

// Silent retention sweep
foreach (glob(GH_LOG_DIR . '/*.{log,txt}', GLOB_BRACE) as $f) {
    if (is_file($f) && (time() - filemtime($f)) > GH_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS * 86400) {
        @unlink($f);
    }
}

if (GH_DEBUG_RESPONSES) {
    header('Content-Type: application/json');
    echo json_encode(['ok' => true, 'name' => $name, 'bytes' => $len]);
} else {
    http_response_code(204);
}
```

The retention sweep runs only on this success path. It is intentionally silent.

**Sizing.** SD log files rotate at **1 MB** (firmware constant `SD_ROTATE_BYTES`, `event_logger.h`) — **since 2.1.2; before that 512 KB**, which is what 1.0 of this document said. A file is rotated after the write that crosses 1 MB, so **a rotated file is slightly over 1 MB**: 1 048 576 to 1 048 618 bytes on both live sites (2026-09-25). **Set `GH_LOG_MAX_BYTES` to 2 MB** (`2 * 1024 * 1024`), and PHP's `post_max_size` above it (e.g. `4M`). The 1 MB this document used to recommend rejects nearly every file: TR-06's check is `$len > GH_LOG_MAX_BYTES`, and a silent 204 means the controller cannot tell. A file closed early — by a reboot — is smaller.

**Log file contents.** Since firmware 2.0.0-a.6.35.3 the CSV row timestamps inside the log are **local time** (matching the controller's TZ — typically CET/CEST). Pre-a.6.35.3 logs had UTC row timestamps inside while filenames were always local time. The server stores the file unchanged; any operator-side log-viewing tool should be aware of this transition. The repo's `log/logparser.py` script handles both transparently — column heading just changes from `Timestamp (UTC)` to `Timestamp (local)`.

### 3.4 Canonical JSON shape — what `api.php` receives

The status payload arrives as a single nested JSON object. The exact shape is produced by `firmware/src/status_post/status_json.cpp::build_canonical_status_json()` and is stable across the 2.0.0 alpha series. Every key the dashboard's `app.js` reads must appear here; the server just stores the bytes and the dashboard does field-by-field access. Field-level presence may vary with the firmware's `cfg.status_expose` mask — the implementer should treat any per-tile object as optional and gate rendering on `s.<tile> != null` as documented in §9.2.

**Top-level**

```json
{
  "type":              "status",
  "climate":           {...},
  "wind":              {...},
  "windows":           {...},
  "mode":              {...},
  "sun":               {...},
  "system":            {...},
  "bus":               [...],
  "update_interval_s": 120
}
```

| Field | Type | Always present? | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | string | yes | Always `"status"` — dispatcher tag for the WebSocket consumer; api.php may ignore. |
| `update_interval_s` | int | yes | Controller's POST cadence (60..300 s). Drives the freshness-tile threshold; missing → spec § 11 falls back to `defaultIntervalS` and appends `"(assumed)"` to the caption. |
| `bus` | array | only with the `system` bit **and** only when at least one Modbus slave has answered since boot | Per-slave bus counters (2.8.0). **Top-level, not inside `system`**, although the `system` bit gates it. See the `bus` subsection below. |
| `climate` / `wind` / `windows` / `mode` / `sun` / `system` | object | conditional on `cfg.status_expose` bitmask | One bit per tile. Operator can hide individual tiles from the public dashboard by clearing the corresponding bit via the Web tab. When a tile object is absent the dashboard hides the matching `#tile-...` element per §9.2. |

**`climate`** (bit 0 of `status_expose`):

```json
"climate": {
  "temp_c":          23.4,
  "temp_avg_c":      23.1,
  "rh_pct":          65,
  "rh_avg_pct":      66,
  "temp_max_active": 28,
  "rh_max_active":   75,
  "rh_min_active":   50,
  "rh_ctrl_enabled": true
}
```

- `temp_c` / `temp_avg_c` are decimals with one fractional digit; the rest are integers.
- **Known firmware defect: the sign is lost between −0.9 and −0.1 °C.** The value is printed as `t_c10 / 10` then `|t_c10| % 10`, and C division truncates towards zero, so −0.5 °C is sent as `0.5`. From −1.0 °C down the sign is correct. A site cannot repair this (the payload does not carry the raw value); read a small positive temperature on a frost night with that in mind. Found while writing this revision; not fixed in firmware as of 2.14.0.
- `rh_max_active` and `rh_min_active` are **omitted** when `rh_ctrl_enabled` is `false` (firmware passes `include_disabled_setpoints=false` for the T14 path). The dashboard should treat them as optional and not render the "RH max/min" rows when absent. `rh_ctrl_enabled` is always present so consumers know which mode is active.

**`wind`** (bit 1):

```json
"wind": {
  "speed_ms":                2.3,
  "speed_avg_ms":            2.1,
  "direction_deg":           180,
  "direction_avg_deg":       175,
  "direction_variation_deg": 60
}
```

- `speed_ms` / `speed_avg_ms` decimals one digit; directions/variation integers.
- `direction_variation_deg` is the arc width (0–359) that the current sliding window's direction samples span — small = steady wind, large = shifting wind.

**`windows`** (bit 2):

```json
"windows": {
  "M1": "OPEN", "M2": "CLOSED", "M3": "PART_OPEN",
  "M3_ctrl_mode":   "LINEAR",
  "M3_ctrl_reason": "setting",
  "M3_pos_gate":    "ok",
  "M3_percent_x10":   252,
  "M3_mm_x10":       3780,
  "M3_at_end_sensor": false
}
```

**State strings** (no `WIN_` prefix): `OPEN`, `CLOSED`, `MOVING_OPEN`, `MOVING_CLOSE`, `UNKNOWN`, and **`PART_OPEN`** (2.12.0). `PART_OPEN` occurs only on M3 and only in linear control: the window was driven to a measured position and stopped there. It is a normal operating state, not a fault — render it as such (§10). M1 and M2 are always fully open or closed.

**M3 control law** — always present with the block, including on a controller without a position sensor:

| Key | Since | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `M3_ctrl_mode` | 2.12.0 | `TIMED`, `LINEAR` | The law **in force**, not the setting. `LINEAR` needs the setting *and* a trusted position. |
| `M3_ctrl_reason` | 2.13.0 | `setting`, `no_position`, `held_down`, `resumed` | Why it is that: decided by the setting; the position is not trusted; trusted again but inside the two-minute hold-down after a demotion; just promoted back. |
| `M3_pos_gate` | 2.13.0 | `ok`, `probing`, `no_sensor`, `device_fault`, `end_sensors`, `not_fitted`, `bench_build` | What the controller makes of the position sensor. It qualifies `M3_ctrl_reason`: `no_position` with `ok` is not a fault — the mode is simply about to be taken up. |

A dashboard that shows only the law needs `M3_ctrl_mode`. The other two are for saying *why*, which is what an operator asks when the setting says linear and the tile says timed.

**M3 position** — present **only** when a position sensor is fitted and trusted, and **absent** otherwise (absent, not zero: a consumer must be able to tell "no sensor" from "fully closed"):

| Key | Since | Unit | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `M3_percent_x10` | 2.7.1 | 0.1 % | Opening. **Not clamped**: the leaf rests past both end sensors, so a parked open window reads about 1137 (113.7 %); a closed one read 0 on the development rig. Clamp to 0..1000 for display if you draw a bar. |
| `M3_mm_x10` | 2.7.1 | 0.1 mm | Opening in millimetres. |
| `M3_at_end_sensor` | 2.7.1 | bool | M3 is on one of its two end sensors. |

**`mode`** (bit 3):

```json
"mode": {
  "current": "AUTOMATIC",
  "flags":   ["humidity_ctrl_off"]
}
```

- `current` is the highest-priority active operating mode label. Priority: `MOTOR_ALARM` > `WIND_OVERRIDE` > `WINDOW_CAL` > `op_mode_t` (`AUTOMATIC` / `STANDBY`).
- `flags` is an array of zero-or-more flag strings — each rendered as a coloured badge in the mode tile. **Sixteen exist as of 2.14.0**; §9.4 lists them with their colour and label. Firmware emission order: `sensor_fault_position`, `m3_not_confirmed`, `m3_travel_short`, `m3_travel_long`, then the event-group flags (`wind_override`, `sensor_fault_temp`, `sensor_fault_wind`, `ota_in_progress`, `motor_alarm`, `calibrating`, `standby`), then `net_backoff_active`, `wind_protect_off`, `humidity_ctrl_off`, `coredump_available`, `rota_update_pending`.

**`sun`** (bit 4):

```json
"sun": {
  "is_daytime":   true,
  "sunrise_min":  335,
  "sunset_min":   1290
}
```

- `sunrise_min` / `sunset_min` are **local minutes from midnight** (DST-adjusted inside the firmware). The dashboard renders them verbatim as `HH:MM`: `Math.floor(min/60) + ":" + String(min%60).padStart(2,"0")`.
- `is_daytime` reflects the current `is_daytime` flag the controller's climate logic uses — small operational signal, not strictly day/night based on solar elevation.

**`system`** (bit 5):

```json
"system": {
  "unit_id":         "2344",
  "wifi_ip":         "192.168.20.160",
  "wifi_rssi_dbm":   -67,
  "ntp_synced":      true,
  "fw_ver":          "2.14.0",
  "asset_version":   "2.14.0",
  "uptime_s":        4530,
  "ts_unix":         1790338019,
  "time_iso":        "2026-09-25T19:48:03",
  "eg1":             0,
  "sd_mounted":      true,
  "sd_free_mb":      29440,
  "sd_size_mb":      30436,
  "heap_free_kb":    66,
  "heap_min_kb":     14,
  "heap_largest_kb": 29
}
```

- `unit_id` is the 4-hex-char short ID derived from the last 2 bytes of the unit's WiFi-STA MAC (gh#17). Same value appears on the LCD info screen, in every SD log filename and its boot row, in the AP SSID (`Greenhouse-XXXX`), and on the local-GUI footer. Treat as the unit's "name" for operator identification across surfaces.
- `fw_ver` and `asset_version` come from different sources; the local GUI shows a `MISMATCH` badge when they differ (incomplete OTA on the controller). Public dashboard may surface the same diagnostic.
- `time_iso` is the controller's local-time clock at the moment the snapshot was built (UTC + the cfg TZ). The dashboard generally renders the server-side `received_at` + browser local clock for the freshness display; `time_iso` is informational.
- `eg1` is the raw EG1 bitset. Public dashboards typically ignore it — the parsed flags are in `mode.flags[]` already.
- `sd_mounted` / `sd_free_mb` / `sd_size_mb` (2.0.2, gh#31): the SD card's mount state and space, MB-rounded, so a remote observer can see an SD failure without asking the controller. `sd_mounted: false` also appears after an operator deliberately **unmounted** the card to swap it; it is not by itself an alarm.
- `heap_free_kb` / `heap_min_kb` (2.2.5) and `heap_largest_kb` (2.2.10): internal RAM, current free, the lowest free since boot, and the largest contiguous free block. **Judge headroom by `heap_free_kb` and `heap_largest_kb` in steady state, not by `heap_min_kb`**: the minimum only ever falls — each TLS handshake of the status POST can push it one step lower — so it reports the worst moment since boot, not what is available now (gh#81).

**`bus`** (with the `system` bit; **top-level**, next to `system`, not inside it; since 2.8.0):

```json
"bus": [
  {"a": 1,  "ok": 1576, "err": 1, "busy": 0, "max": 1},
  {"a": 40, "ok": 9699, "err": 0, "busy": 0, "max": 0},
  {"a": 44, "ok": 3152, "err": 1, "busy": 0, "max": 1}
]
```

- One entry per Modbus slave: `a` address, `ok` good transactions, `err` failed ones (timeouts, CRC, exceptions, framing and parameter errors together), `busy` attempts that found the bus in use by another task, `max` the longest run of consecutive failures.
- **Totals since the controller booted**, not rates. Two samples and their `uptime_s` give a rate; a reboot resets them.
- `busy` is **contention, not a slave failure** — keep it apart from `err` in anything you draw.
- **Omitted entirely** until at least one slave has answered since boot (absent, not an array of zeros). Address 40, the M3 position sensor, is left out on a controller that has no position sensor fitted.
- Addresses as installed: 1 is the temperature/humidity sensor, 40 the M3 position sensor, 44 the wind sensor.

**Field stability guarantee.** Adding a field to an existing object is non-breaking: the dashboard ignores keys it does not know. **Adding a new *value* to an existing field is also a change, and consumers must tolerate it** — 1.0 of this document promised only the first, and `PART_OPEN` (2.12.0) showed the difference: a site that maps window states through a closed table fell back to its `UNKNOWN` colour for a working window. So: treat every string enumeration here (`windows.*` states, `mode.current`, `mode.flags[]`, `M3_ctrl_mode`, `M3_ctrl_reason`, `M3_pos_gate`) as **open** — render an unknown value neutrally and visibly (its raw text, in a neutral colour), never as a fault and never not at all. Adding new `mode.flags[]` strings stays non-breaking (§9.4 skips unknowns). Removing or renaming an existing field, or changing a field's unit, requires a coordinated controller + dashboard release.
---

## 4. Backend — browser read API (`view.php`)

Accepts only `GET`. Dispatches by `$_GET['action']`.

### 4.1 Common entry checks

```php
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] !== 'GET') {
    if (GH_DEBUG_RESPONSES) {
        http_response_code(405);
        header('Content-Type: application/json');
        echo json_encode(['error' => 'method_not_allowed']);
    } else {
        http_response_code(204);
    }
    exit;
}

header('Cache-Control: no-store');
header('Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8');
```

`view.php` is the only browser-facing PHP entrypoint. Hardening hooks live here:

- `Cache-Control: no-store` to prevent stale CDN copies.
- (Optional, future) IP allowlist or token-bucket rate limit at the top of the file.
- (Optional, future) Basic Auth via `.htaccess` on `view.php` only.

### 4.2 Read status (no `action` query parameter)

```php
if (!is_file(GH_STATUS_FILE)) {
    echo '{}';
    exit;
}

$json = file_get_contents(GH_STATUS_FILE);
$payload = json_decode($json, true);
if (!is_array($payload)) {
    echo '{}';
    exit;
}

$received = (int) ($payload['received_at'] ?? 0);
$payload['age_seconds'] = $received > 0 ? max(0, time() - $received) : null;
echo json_encode($payload);
```

### 4.3 List logs (`?action=logs`)

```php
$out = [];
foreach (glob(GH_LOG_DIR . '/*.{log,txt}', GLOB_BRACE) as $f) {
    if (is_file($f)) {
        $out[] = [
            'name'  => basename($f),
            'size'  => filesize($f),
            'mtime' => filemtime($f),
        ];
    }
}
usort($out, fn($a, $b) => $b['mtime'] - $a['mtime']);
echo json_encode($out);
```

---

## 5. Backend — log download (`log/logs/`)

Files are served directly by Apache. No PHP script wraps them. Security is enforced by the directory `.htaccess` (§ 13).

A successful request:

- `GET /log/logs/2026-05-10_120030.log` → 200 with `Content-Type: text/plain`, file content as body.

A blocked request:

- `GET /log/logs/` → 403 (directory listing disabled).
- `GET /log/logs/anything.php` → 403 (extension not whitelisted).
- `GET /log/logs/../config.php` → handled by Apache's path normalisation and the directory whitelist; never reaches `config.php`.

---

## 6. Storage model

### 6.1 Latest status

A single file at `data/status.json` containing the most recent payload plus a server-added `received_at` (Unix epoch seconds). No history, no rotation.

### 6.2 Atomic write

All writes go through a `.tmp` file and are renamed onto the destination:

```php
$tmp = GH_STATUS_FILE . '.tmp';
file_put_contents($tmp, json_encode($payload), LOCK_EX);
rename($tmp, GH_STATUS_FILE);
```

`rename()` is atomic on POSIX filesystems and on Windows when source and destination are on the same volume. `view.php` reads with a single `file_get_contents()` and never sees a partial file.

### 6.3 Log retention

The retention sweep runs only on the success path of `POST /api.php?action=log`. It deletes files matching `*.log`/`*.txt` in `GH_LOG_DIR` whose `mtime` is older than `GH_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` days. With one upload per 24 h and a 90-day retention, the steady-state file count is ≈ 90.

Failures during sweep (e.g. permission denied on `unlink`) are swallowed via `@unlink` so they cannot fail the upload response.

## 7. Frontend — `index.php` shell

Server-rendered HTML. Responsibilities, in order:

1. `<!doctype html>` skeleton.
2. `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`.
3. Inject runtime config:
   ```html
   <script>
     window.GH_CFG = {
       pollMs:           <?= (int) GH_POLL_INTERVAL_MS ?>,
       defaultIntervalS: <?= (int) GH_DEFAULT_INTERVAL_S ?>,
       windowNames:      <?= json_encode(GH_WINDOW_NAMES) ?>
     };
   </script>
   ```
4. Render tile containers with stable IDs:
   - `#tile-freshness` — visible immediately, contains the bar track, fill, caption and `<span id="fresh-offline" hidden>`.
   - `#tile-climate`, `#tile-wind`, `#tile-windows`, `#tile-mode`, `#tile-sun`, `#tile-system` — start with the `hidden` attribute.
   - There is **no** `#tile-logs` on the dashboard. Logs live on a separate page; see § 7.1 below.
5. Include `assets/style.css` and `assets/app.js`. Both `<link>` and `<script>` tags carry a `?v=<filemtime>` cache-buster so a fresh deploy invalidates the browser cache without requiring a hard refresh.
6. The shell never renders dynamic data server-side. Everything dynamic flows through `GET /view.php`.

### 7.1 Separate logs page (`httproot/log/index.php`)

A self-contained, server-rendered page. Not linked from `index.php`,
not referenced from `app.js` — only findable by knowing the URL
`/<deploy-prefix>/log/`. The page lives in the same `log/` directory
that holds the `logs/` storage subdirectory, so download links resolve
relatively to `logs/<name>`. Responsibilities:

1. `require __DIR__ . '/../config.php'` (one level up).
2. `glob(GH_LOG_DIR . '/*.{log,txt}', GLOB_BRACE)` and sort newest-first by mtime.
3. Render rows with the filename + size + date on the left and an explicit Download button (`<a class="btn-download" href="logs/<name>" download>Download</a>`) on the right. Filenames are `htmlspecialchars()`-escaped.
4. Reuse `assets/style.css` (also via `?v=<filemtime>` for cache busting).
5. Reuse the dashboard footer for visual consistency.

Removing the dashboard's logs tile separated "operator-relevant live data" from "diagnostic file dump", so the dashboard stays clean while the files remain available when needed.

---

## 8. Frontend — `assets/style.css`

Inherits the dark-theme variables from `documentation/webguiExample/data/style.css` and adds three colors used by the windows tile.

```css
:root {
  /* from webguiExample */
  --bg:     #1a1a2e;
  --card:   #16213e;
  --accent: #0f3460;
  --fg:     #e0e0e0;
  --muted:  #999;
  --green:  #4caf50;
  --red:    #f44336;
  --yellow: #ff9800;

  /* added for the windows tile */
  --blue-light: #7ec8e3;
  --green-dark: #1f5132;
  --grey-muted: #5a6275;
}

/* Force the HTML `hidden` attribute to win over class-based display rules.
   Without this, e.g. `.badge { display: inline-block }` overrides
   `[hidden] { display: none }` from the user-agent stylesheet, and the
   OFFLINE pill stays visible regardless of what app.js does. */
[hidden] { display: none !important; }

.tiles {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(160px, 1fr));
  gap: 12px;
  max-width: 900px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 12px;
}
.tile { background: var(--card); border-radius: 8px; padding: 12px; }

.tile-freshness { grid-column: 1 / -1; }      /* full row, top of grid */
.tile-windows   { grid-column: span 2; min-width: 280px; }

.dashboard.stale .tile { opacity: 0.55; }
.dashboard.stale .tile-freshness { opacity: 1; }   /* heartbeat stays bright */
```

Freshness bar styling (mirrors the `live-fetch-track` pattern from `webguiExample`):

```css
.fresh-track {
  height: 14px;
  background: var(--bg);
  border: 1px solid var(--accent);
  border-radius: 4px;
  overflow: hidden;
}
.fresh-fill {
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  border-radius: 4px;
  transition: width 1s linear, background-color 200ms linear;
}
```

Mobile-specific rule (reduces the windows tile back to a single column on narrow screens so its three bars stay legible):

```css
@media (max-width: 480px) {
  .tile-windows { grid-column: 1 / -1; }
}
```

---

## 9. Frontend — `assets/app.js`

### 9.1 Polling loop

```js
const cfg = window.GH_CFG;
let lastPayload = null;
let failCount = 0;
let anchor = null;       // see § 11.1

async function tick() {
  try {
    const r = await fetch('view.php', { cache: 'no-store' });
    if (!r.ok) throw new Error('http ' + r.status);
    const s = await r.json();
    failCount = 0;
    onPayload(s);
    render(s);
  } catch (e) {
    if (++failCount >= 3) showConnLostBanner();
  }
}
setInterval(tick, cfg.pollMs);
tick();
```

`app.js` calls **only** `view.php`, using a **relative** URL so the site
works under any URL prefix (e.g. when deployed at `/controller/`). It
never calls `api.php`. There is no log-list polling on the dashboard;
logs are surfaced through the standalone `/<prefix>/log/` page (§ 7.1).

### 9.2 `render(s)` show/hide

For each tile, check the presence predicate; toggle the `hidden` attribute. Then for visible tiles, write `textContent` for each line if its key is present, hide that line otherwise.

Predicates:

```js
const TILES = {
  'tile-climate':  s => s.climate  != null,
  'tile-wind':     s => s.wind     != null,
  'tile-windows':  s => s.windows  != null,
  'tile-mode':     s => s.mode     != null,
  'tile-sun':      s => s.sun      != null,
  'tile-system':   s => s.system   != null,
  // tile-freshness is always visible — not in this map
};
```

All payload-derived strings are written via `textContent`, never `innerHTML`.

### 9.3 Connection-lost banner

A `<div id="conn-banner" hidden>` at the top of the body. `showConnLostBanner()` removes its `hidden`. A subsequent successful `tick()` calls `hideConnLostBanner()` (omitted from the snippet for brevity).

### 9.4 Mode tile — `mode.flags[]` badge rendering

The `mode` tile renders two pieces of information from `payload.mode`:

1. The `current` string as a primary state line / coloured pill (`AUTOMATIC` / `STANDBY` / `WIND_OVERRIDE` / `MOTOR_ALARM` / `WINDOW_CAL`).
2. Each entry of `flags[]` as a coloured badge below the primary line. Order matches firmware emission order. Empty array → no badges (the mode tile shows just the `current` line).

Rendering uses a fixed flag-string → CSS-class lookup. Unknown flag strings are silently ignored (forward-compatible — a future controller can emit new flags without breaking older dashboards).

```js
// Lookup table — mirrors firmware/data/app.js flagBadges, kept in sync with
// firmware/src/status_post/status_json.cpp EG1_FLAGS + the post-loop
// operator-disabled flags appended in build_canonical_status_json.
const FLAG_CLASS = {
  // RED — alarm/fault. Operator attention required.
  'wind_override':         'alarm',  // T3 safety_monitor — windows closed by wind safety
  'motor_alarm':           'alarm',  // T2 relay_controller — emergency stop

  // YELLOW — warn / transient.
  'sensor_fault_temp':     'warn',   // T5 sensor_poll — T/RH sensor not responding
  'sensor_fault_wind':     'warn',   // T5 sensor_poll — wind sensor not responding
  'sensor_fault_position': 'warn',   // 2.7.1 — M3 position sensor fitted but unusable; M3 falls back to timed
  'm3_not_confirmed':      'warn',   // 2.10.0 — M3's last drive did not reach the end sensor it aimed for
  'm3_travel_short':       'warn',   // 2.10.0 — measured traverse longer than the configured travel time
  'm3_travel_long':        'warn',   // 2.10.0 — measured traverse under half the configured travel time
  'ota_in_progress':       'warn',   // T13 ota_manager — firmware/asset upload in flight
  'calibrating':           'warn',   // T2 boot-time window-position calibration
  'standby':               'warn',   // operator paused the controller (mode.current is STANDBY too)
  'net_backoff_active':    'warn',   // T14 circuit breaker open after consecutive POST failures
  'wind_protect_off':      'warn',   // operator set cfg.wind_prot_en = 0 — wind safety disabled

  // BLUE — informational (operator-configured state, not a fault).
  'humidity_ctrl_off':     'info',   // operator set cfg.rh_ctrl_en = 0 — RH-driven control off
  'coredump_available':    'info',   // panic dump waiting in flash; admin can retrieve via local GUI
  'rota_update_pending':   'info',   // 2.2.2 — an update is downloaded and waits for its apply window
};

// Labels are the controller's own (firmware/data/app.js), so an operator sees
// the same words on the controller and on the dashboard.
const FLAG_LABEL = {
  'wind_override':         'WIND',
  'motor_alarm':           'MOTOR ALARM',
  'sensor_fault_temp':     'T/RH fault',
  'sensor_fault_wind':     'Wind fault',
  'sensor_fault_position': 'Window sensor fault',
  'm3_not_confirmed':      'M3 not confirmed',
  'm3_travel_short':       'M3 travel time too short',
  'm3_travel_long':        'M3 travel time too long',
  'ota_in_progress':       'OTA active',
  'calibrating':           'Calibrating',
  'standby':               'Standby',
  'net_backoff_active':    'Net backoff',
  'wind_protect_off':      'Wind protect off',
  'humidity_ctrl_off':     'Humidity ctrl off',
  'coredump_available':    'Coredump available',
  'rota_update_pending':   'Update pending',
};

// Note: `net_backoff_active` is defined but, as of 2.14.0, never emitted — the
// breaker is not wired (gh#18 Phase 1 returns false). Keep the row.

function renderModeBadges(flags) {
  const tile = document.getElementById('mode-badges');
  if (!tile) return;
  tile.replaceChildren();   // remove previous badges
  if (!Array.isArray(flags)) return;
  for (const f of flags) {
    const cls   = FLAG_CLASS[f];
    const label = FLAG_LABEL[f] || f;
    if (!cls) continue;     // unknown flag — silently skip
    const span = document.createElement('span');
    span.className   = 'badge ' + cls;
    span.textContent = label;
    tile.appendChild(span);
  }
}
```

CSS classes for badges (see §8 for the existing colour variables):

```css
.badge        { display: inline-block; padding: 2px 8px; border-radius: 4px;
                font-size: .75rem; font-weight: 700; margin-right: 4px; }
.badge.alarm  { background: var(--red);    color: #fff; }
.badge.warn   { background: var(--yellow); color: #000; }
.badge.info   { background: var(--blue);   color: #fff; }
```

If your `style.css` doesn't yet have a `--blue` variable, add it alongside the existing colour variables — a saturated value like `#2196f3` matches the local web GUI's blue badge. The `info` class is required for the two a.6.35.4/6 informational flags.

**Forward compatibility.** Adding new entries to `FLAG_CLASS` and `FLAG_LABEL` (and rebuilding the dashboard) makes the new flags visible. Until that update, unknown flag strings emitted by a newer controller are silently dropped — operationally safe, no console errors.

## 10. Windows tile SVG

Inline SVG, `viewBox="0 0 200 140"`, embedded in `index.php`. North at top, with M3 along the top edge.

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 200 140" role="img" aria-label="Window status" class="windows-svg">
  <rect x="2" y="2" width="196" height="136" rx="4"
        fill="none" stroke="var(--fg)" stroke-width="1"/>

  <text x="100" y="10"  text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="middle" font-size="6" fill="var(--muted)">N</text>
  <text x="100" y="130" text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="middle" font-size="6" fill="var(--muted)">S</text>

  <g>
    <title id="title-m3">M3 North wall: UNKNOWN</title>
    <rect id="rect-m3" x="14" y="18" width="172" height="34" rx="4" fill="var(--grey-muted)"/>
    <text id="lbl-m3"  x="100" y="35" text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="middle"
          font-size="10" font-weight="bold" fill="var(--fg)">M3 North wall UNKNOWN</text>
  </g>

  <g>
    <title id="title-m2">M2 North roof: UNKNOWN</title>
    <rect id="rect-m2" x="14" y="66" width="172" height="22" rx="3" fill="var(--grey-muted)"/>
    <text id="lbl-m2"  x="100" y="77" text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="middle"
          font-size="10" font-weight="bold" fill="var(--fg)">M2 North roof UNKNOWN</text>
  </g>

  <g>
    <title id="title-m1">M1 South roof: UNKNOWN</title>
    <rect id="rect-m1" x="14" y="100" width="172" height="22" rx="3" fill="var(--grey-muted)"/>
    <text id="lbl-m1"  x="100" y="111" text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="middle"
          font-size="10" font-weight="bold" fill="var(--fg)">M1 South roof UNKNOWN</text>
  </g>
</svg>
```

All three bars share the same 172-unit width; only their heights differ.
M3 is 34 tall (`y=18..52`), M2 and M1 are each 22 tall (`y=66..88` and
`y=100..122` respectively). The greenhouse outer rect uses 2-unit margins
to fill the SVG viewBox. Label text is `font-size="10"` and
`font-weight="bold"` for legibility on a phone (matches the OFFLINE pill
visual weight while sitting comfortably inside the bars).

JS update:

```js
const W = ['M1', 'M2', 'M3'];
const COLOR = {
  OPEN:         'var(--blue-light)',
  PART_OPEN:    'var(--blue-light)',   // 2.12.0 — a normal state, drawn as open (the label says how far)
  MOVING_OPEN:  'var(--yellow)',
  MOVING_CLOSE: 'var(--yellow)',
  CLOSED:       'var(--green-dark)',
  UNKNOWN:      'var(--grey-muted)',
};
// An unknown state (a value added after this site was built) is drawn in the
// neutral grey WITH its raw text, per the stability guarantee in §3.4 —
// never silently as UNKNOWN.
function shortState(s) {
  return ({ MOVING_OPEN: 'MOV OPEN', MOVING_CLOSE: 'MOV CLOSE', PART_OPEN: 'PART' }[s]) || s || 'UNKNOWN';
}
// M3 carries its opening when a position sensor is fitted and trusted. The
// value is not clamped (a parked open window reads ~113 %), so clamp for display.
function m3Percent(windows) {
  const p = windows && windows.M3_percent_x10;
  if (typeof p !== 'number') return '';
  return ' ' + Math.round(Math.max(0, Math.min(1000, p)) / 10) + '%';
}
// OPEN's light-blue background needs dark text for legibility; everything
// else stays on the foreground colour.
function textColorFor(state) {
  return (state === 'OPEN' || state === 'PART_OPEN') ? '#000' : 'var(--fg)';
}
function renderWindows(windows) {
  for (const id of W) {
    const state = (windows && windows[id]) || 'UNKNOWN';
    const rect  = document.getElementById('rect-'  + id.toLowerCase());
    const lbl   = document.getElementById('lbl-'   + id.toLowerCase());
    const title = document.getElementById('title-' + id.toLowerCase());
    rect.setAttribute('fill', COLOR[state] || COLOR.UNKNOWN);
    lbl.setAttribute('fill', textColorFor(state));
    const pct = (id === 'M3') ? m3Percent(windows) : '';
    lbl.textContent = `${id} ${cfg.windowNames[id]} ${shortState(state)}${pct}`;

## 11. Freshness tile rendering

### 11.1 Drift-resistant age tracking

`view.php` polls happen every 5 s but the bar must redraw every second. The browser anchors against the server-reported `age_seconds` at fetch time and uses its own monotonic clock for in-between updates:

```js
function onPayload(s) {
  lastPayload = s;
  anchor = {
    fetchedAtMono: performance.now(),
    ageAtFetch:    Number.isFinite(s.age_seconds) ? s.age_seconds : Infinity,
  };
}
function currentAgeS() {
  if (!anchor) return Infinity;
  return anchor.ageAtFetch + (performance.now() - anchor.fetchedAtMono) / 1000;
}
```

This avoids any dependency on browser↔server clock sync.

### 11.2 1 Hz redraw loop

```js
function renderFreshness() {
  const interval = (lastPayload && lastPayload.update_interval_s) || cfg.defaultIntervalS;
  const age      = currentAgeS();
  const fillFrac = Math.max(0, Math.min(1, 1 - age / (4 * interval)));
  const color    =
    age <= 2 * interval ? 'var(--green)'  :
    age <= 4 * interval ? 'var(--yellow)' :
                          'var(--red)';

  const bar = document.getElementById('fresh-fill');
  bar.style.width = (fillFrac * 100) + '%';
  bar.style.background = color;

  document.getElementById('fresh-caption').textContent =
    formatCaption(lastPayload, age, interval);

  document.getElementById('fresh-offline').hidden = age <= 4 * interval;

  // Drive the dashboard-wide stale dim from the freshness tile state
  document.querySelector('.dashboard').classList.toggle('stale', age > 4 * interval);
}
setInterval(renderFreshness, 1000);
renderFreshness();   // initial render so the tile isn't blank before first fetch
```

`formatCaption` emits:
- "No data yet" if `lastPayload` is null or `received_at` is missing.
- Otherwise `"Last update HH:MM:SS · interval Ns · age Ns"`. Append "(assumed)" after the interval value if `update_interval_s` was missing from the payload.

### 11.3 No-data startup

Before the first successful fetch:
- `lastPayload` is `null`, `anchor` is `null`, `currentAgeS()` returns `Infinity`.
- The bar renders 0 % wide and red, "OFFLINE" badge visible.
- Caption reads "No data yet".

This is the desired behavior: an empty dashboard immediately shows red on the heartbeat.

## 12. HTTP status codes and silent-drop flow

```
Per POST endpoint (api.php):
1. method != POST                              → 204 (debug: 405)
2. header sourceidentifier != GH_SECRET_TOKEN  → 204 (debug: 401)
3. body invalid (parse / size / shape)         → 204 (debug: 400 or 413)
4. side effect succeeds                        → 204 (debug: 200 + JSON body)

Per GET endpoint (view.php):
1. method != GET                               → 204 (debug: 405)
2. always returns a useful body, even when status is missing ({})
```

Cross-method requests on the wrong file are rejected by step 1 of the corresponding endpoint. This makes a misrouted browser fetch fail loudly in debug mode.

---

## 13. Apache configuration (`.htaccess`)

### 13.1 `data/.htaccess`

```apache
Require all denied
```

### 13.2 `log/logs/.htaccess`

```apache
Options -Indexes
<FilesMatch "^[0-9A-Za-z._-]+\.(log|txt)$">
    ForceType text/plain
    Header set Content-Disposition "attachment"
</FilesMatch>
<FilesMatch "^(?!^[0-9A-Za-z._-]+\.(log|txt)$).*$">
    Require all denied
</FilesMatch>
```

This:
- disables directory listings,
- restricts what files are servable (alphanumerics, dot, underscore, dash; `.log` or `.txt`),
- forces a plaintext content type and download disposition,
- denies anything not matching the whitelist.

### 13.3 Optional: gate `view.php` with Basic Auth

Drop into the project root if dashboard privacy is later wanted:

```apache
<Files "view.php">
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Greenhouse status"
    AuthUserFile /path/to/.htpasswd
    Require valid-user
</Files>
```

This affects only the read API. The controller-write path (`api.php`) is untouched.

---

## 14. Verification plan

After the implementation session, run through this list manually.

### 14.1 Backend

- [ ] `curl -X POST -H "sourceidentifier: <secret>" --data-binary @sample.json https://host/api.php` → 204 (or 200 in debug). `data/status.json` exists, contains `received_at`.
- [ ] Same call without the header → 204. `data/status.json` is unchanged.
- [ ] `curl https://host/view.php` → 200 JSON containing the payload plus `age_seconds`.
- [ ] `curl -X POST https://host/view.php` → 204 (or 405 in debug). No state change.
- [ ] `curl -X GET https://host/api.php` → 204 (or 405 in debug).
- [ ] `curl -X POST -H "sourceidentifier: <secret>" --data-binary @log.txt "https://host/api.php?action=log"` → file appears in `log/logs/` with a `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.log` name.
- [ ] `curl https://host/view.php?action=logs` → newest-first JSON list including the new file.
- [ ] `curl https://host/log/logs/<file>` → file contents.
- [ ] `curl https://host/log/logs/` → 403 (directory listing disabled).
- [ ] `curl https://host/log/logs/whatever.php` → 403.
- [ ] Touch a log file's mtime to 100 days ago, then re-POST a new log → old file is gone.

### 14.2 Frontend

- [ ] Open `https://host/` in Chrome DevTools at 360×800. All tiles populate within `GH_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`.
- [ ] DevTools Network tab confirms **no** `sourceidentifier` header on any browser request.
- [ ] Drop the `wind` object from the payload → wind tile hides. Drop just `wind.direction_deg` → only that line hides.
- [ ] Set the three M1/M2/M3 states in turn (OPEN, MOVING_OPEN, CLOSED) → SVG bars change color (light blue / amber / dark green) with M3 at the top.
- [ ] Send `update_interval_s: 10`. Wait 25 seconds without further updates. Freshness tile turns amber. Wait 45 s total. Tile turns red and the rest of the dashboard dims.
- [ ] On a fresh fetch after a long gap, the "Connection lost" banner clears, the freshness tile and dashboard recover.
- [ ] Toggle `GH_DEBUG_RESPONSES = true`. POSTs return verbose JSON; cross-method requests return 405 with a JSON error.

### 14.3 Mobile sanity

- [ ] Phone-sized viewport: freshness tile spans full width at top; windows tile keeps its three bars legible; logs tile spans full width at the bottom.
- [ ] Tap targets are large enough — log download links don't need a stylus.

## 15. Testable requirements

Each requirement is an implementation-level check that the spec is followed. IDs are stable. The "Implements" column traces each TR back to one or more functional requirements in [functional-design.md § 14](functional-design.md#14-testable-requirements). The "Verification" column describes a concrete test.

### 15.1 Backend — `api.php` (controller ingest)

| ID | Requirement | Implements | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| TR-01 | `api.php` rejects any request whose method is not `POST`. | FR-01, FR-02 | `curl -X GET https://host/api.php` → 204 (or 405 in debug). No state change. |
| TR-02 | `api.php` verifies `HTTP_SOURCEIDENTIFIER === GH_SECRET_TOKEN` before any state mutation. | FR-02, FR-04 | Send POST with wrong header → no file written, response is silent 204. |
| TR-03 | `api.php` writes `status.json` via a `.tmp` file followed by `rename()`. | FR-01 | Inspect filesystem during a long-running write or set up a probe to read mid-write; never observes a partial file. |
| TR-04 | `api.php` generates log filenames as `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.log` from server time. | FR-03 | Upload a log; resulting filename matches `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}_\d{6}\.log$`. |
| TR-05 | `api.php` discards any client-supplied filename. | FR-03, FR-37 | POST log with custom `Content-Disposition: filename="evil.php"`; resulting filename is server-generated and ends in `.log`. |
| TR-06 | `api.php` rejects log uploads exceeding `GH_LOG_MAX_BYTES` before reading the request body. | FR-05 | POST with `Content-Length` larger than the cap → no file stored, response is silent 204 (or 413 in debug). |
| TR-07 | `api.php` runs the retention sweep only on the upload-success path. | FR-07 | Touch a log file's mtime to the past; trigger a non-upload path (status push, malformed upload). The old file remains. |
| TR-08 | `api.php` returns HTTP 204 with empty body on every error path when `GH_DEBUG_RESPONSES = false`. | FR-08 | Send malformed and unauthorized requests; response status is 204 and body length is 0 in all cases. |
| TR-09 | `api.php` returns HTTP 4xx with a JSON error body on error paths when `GH_DEBUG_RESPONSES = true`. | FR-09 | Same triggers as TR-08 with debug on; responses carry a 4xx code and a JSON `{"error":...}` body. |

### 15.2 Backend — `view.php` (browser read)

| ID | Requirement | Implements | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| TR-10 | `view.php` rejects any request whose method is not `GET`. | FR-10 | `curl -X POST https://host/view.php` → 204 (or 405 in debug). |
| TR-11 | `view.php` does not read or accept the value of `GH_SECRET_TOKEN`. | FR-35 | Code review: `view.php` contains no reference to `GH_SECRET_TOKEN`; log analysis confirms no `sourceidentifier` lookup on the read path. |
| TR-12 | `view.php` sets `Cache-Control: no-store` on all responses. | — | Read response headers; `Cache-Control: no-store` is present. |
| TR-13 | `view.php` sets `Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8` on all responses. | — | Read response headers. |
| TR-14 | `view.php` returns `{}` with HTTP 200 when `GH_STATUS_FILE` does not exist. | FR-14 | Wipe `data/status.json`; GET → 200, body `{}`. |
| TR-15 | Successful read responses include an `age_seconds` field. | FR-13 | GET after a recent push; the response contains `age_seconds` ≥ 0. |
| TR-16 | The log list is sorted by `mtime` descending. | — | Upload three logs over time; the list returns them newest first. |

### 15.3 Storage and Apache configuration

| ID | Requirement | Implements | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| TR-17 | `data/.htaccess` issues `Require all denied`. | FR-36 | `curl https://host/data/status.json` → 403. |
| TR-18 | `log/logs/.htaccess` disables directory listings. | FR-38 | `curl https://host/log/logs/` → 403. |
| TR-19 | `log/logs/.htaccess` permits only filenames matching `^[0-9A-Za-z._-]+\.(log\|txt)$`. | FR-37 | Place a file named `bad name.exe` in the directory; URL access is denied. |
| TR-20 | `log/logs/` files served carry `Content-Type: text/plain`. | — | Read response headers on a download. |
| TR-21 | Status writes are atomic via `.tmp` + `rename()`. | FR-01 | Same as TR-03. |

### 15.4 Configuration

| ID | Requirement | Implements | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| TR-22 | `config.php` defines all constants listed in § 2 of this document. | — | Static check: every constant referenced in `api.php`, `view.php`, `index.php` is defined in `config.php`. |
| TR-23 | `GH_SECRET_TOKEN` is a string of at least 16 characters drawn from a non-trivial alphabet. | FR-02, FR-04 | Inspect `config.php`; reject deployments where the token is empty, default, or under 16 characters. |
| TR-24 | `GH_DEBUG_RESPONSES` defaults to `false`. | FR-08 | Inspect `config.php` in production. |

### 15.5 Frontend wiring

| ID | Requirement | Implements | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| TR-25 | `assets/app.js` issues fetches only to `view.php`, using a **relative** path so the site is portable to any URL prefix (e.g. `/controller/`). It never fetches `api.php`. | FR-35 | DevTools Network tab during normal operation shows requests to `view.php` resolved against the current page; never `api.php`. |
| TR-26 | `assets/app.js` writes payload-derived strings via `textContent`. It never assigns to `innerHTML` from payload data. | FR-39 | Code review and a probe: send a status field containing `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`; the dashboard displays the literal text without firing the script. |
| TR-27 | `index.php` injects `window.GH_CFG` with `pollMs`, `defaultIntervalS`, and `windowNames`. | FR-25, FR-44 | View page source; the inline `<script>` declares all three keys. |
| TR-28 | All tile container DOM IDs match the spec list (`tile-freshness`, `tile-climate`, `tile-wind`, `tile-windows`, `tile-mode`, `tile-sun`, `tile-system`). There is no `tile-logs`; logs are served by the standalone `/<prefix>/log/` page. | FR-15, FR-17 | Inspect rendered HTML. |
| TR-29 | `tile-freshness` does not carry the `hidden` attribute on initial render; all other tile containers do. | FR-17 | Inspect rendered HTML before the first fetch completes. |

### 15.6 Frontend — freshness tile

| ID | Requirement | Implements | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| TR-30 | The freshness tile re-renders at intervals no greater than 1 second. | FR-24 | Set a debug counter on the redraw function; observe ≥ 1 invocation per second over a 10-second window. |
| TR-31 | Age is anchored against the server-reported `age_seconds` at fetch time and advanced using `performance.now()` between fetches. | FR-13, FR-19, FR-20, FR-21 | Code review of the anchor/redraw logic. Adjust the browser system clock by ±60 s; freshness colour and age caption are unaffected. |
| TR-32 | The dashboard root element receives the `stale` class iff the freshness state is red. | FR-23 | Inspect `<body class>` (or dashboard root) at known ages on either side of the 4× interval threshold. |
| TR-33 | The freshness tile renders the literal string `"No data yet"` when the read API returns `{}`. | FR-26 | Wipe stored status; reload the dashboard; observe the caption. |
| TR-34 | When `update_interval_s` is missing from the payload, the caption appends the literal string `"(assumed)"` after the interval value. | FR-25 | Send a payload without `update_interval_s`; reload; observe the caption. |

### 15.7 Frontend — windows tile

| ID | Requirement | Implements | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| TR-35 | The windows SVG uses `viewBox="0 0 200 140"`. | FR-27 | Inspect SVG markup. |
| TR-36 | M1, M2, M3 rects all have `width="172"`. M3 has `height="34"`; M1 and M2 each have `height="22"`. | FR-29 | Inspect SVG markup. |
| TR-37 | The compass labels `N` and `S` appear at the top and bottom of the SVG respectively. | FR-27 | Inspect SVG markup. |
| TR-38 | Each window bar's `<title>` element carries the full unabbreviated state name. | FR-34 | Send `"M1":"MOVING_OPEN"`; the `<title>` text is `M1 South roof: MOVING_OPEN`, not `MOV OPEN`. |
| TR-39 | The state-to-fill mapping in JS produces `var(--blue-light)` for OPEN, `var(--yellow)` for MOVING_*, `var(--green-dark)` for CLOSED, `var(--grey-muted)` for UNKNOWN/missing/unrecognised. | FR-30, FR-31, FR-32, FR-33 | Code review of the `COLOR` map and `renderWindows()` fallback. |

### 15.8 Cross-cutting

| ID | Requirement | Implements | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| TR-40 | HTTP 204 vs 4xx dispatch is governed exclusively by `GH_DEBUG_RESPONSES`. | FR-08, FR-09 | Toggle the flag; verify TR-08/TR-09/TR-10 behaviors flip in unison. |
| TR-41 | All endpoints that emit JSON do so via `json_encode()` with no manual string concatenation of payload data. | FR-39 | Code review. |
| TR-42 | The retention sweep uses `mtime` (not `ctime` or `atime`) for the age comparison. | FR-06, FR-07 | Touch a file's `mtime` only; the sweep treats it as the determining timestamp. |

### 15.9 Canonical JSON shape (since firmware 2.0.0-a.6.35.x)

| ID | Requirement | Implements | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| TR-43 | The dashboard accepts payloads with any subset of the per-tile objects (`climate` / `wind` / `windows` / `mode` / `sun` / `system`) — driven by the controller's `status_expose` bitmask. Missing tiles hide their `#tile-...` element (per TR-28 + §9.2) instead of erroring. | FR-15, FR-17 | Send a payload omitting `wind`; the dashboard renders without a Wind tile and the console shows no `TypeError`. |
| TR-44 | `update_interval_s` is read as an integer 60..300 if present; falls back to `GH_CFG.defaultIntervalS` with `"(assumed)"` appended to the freshness caption when absent. | FR-25 | Send payload without `update_interval_s`; freshness caption shows `"… interval Ns (assumed)"` per TR-34. |
| TR-45 | `system.unit_id` is rendered as a 4-character identifier alongside `fw_ver` in a single line (e.g. `v2.0.0-a.6.35.7 · 2344`) so an operator viewing the public dashboard can identify which physical unit the data belongs to. | gh#17 contract | Send `system.unit_id = "2344"`; visible somewhere in the system tile or footer. |
| TR-46 | `sun.sunrise_min` and `sun.sunset_min` are rendered verbatim as `HH:MM` using `Math.floor(min/60) + ":" + String(min%60).padStart(2,"0")`. Values are local minutes (DST-adjusted by the firmware); the dashboard does NOT apply any further TZ offset. | §3.4 sun-tile contract | Send `sunrise_min: 335`; rendered as `05:35`. |

### 15.10 Mode-tile badge rendering (`mode.flags[]`)

| ID | Requirement | Implements | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| TR-47 | The dashboard's `FLAG_CLASS` table contains entries for all eleven currently-defined flag strings (§9.4): `wind_override`, `motor_alarm`, `sensor_fault_temp`, `sensor_fault_wind`, `ota_in_progress`, `calibrating`, `net_backoff_active`, `wind_protect_off`, `humidity_ctrl_off`, `coredump_available` (also: any future strings emitted by `status_json.cpp`). Each maps to a CSS badge class (`alarm` / `warn` / `info`). | §9.4 | Code review of `FLAG_CLASS` in `assets/app.js`; live test by injecting payloads containing each flag string in turn and verifying the badge renders with the expected colour. |
| TR-48 | Unknown flag strings (not in the `FLAG_CLASS` table) are silently dropped without console errors and without breaking the rendering of known siblings. This preserves forward compatibility when a controller upgrade emits a new flag the dashboard hasn't been updated for yet. | Forward-compat contract | Send `mode.flags = ["wind_override", "future_unknown_flag", "humidity_ctrl_off"]`; the rendered badge list is `[WIND, Humidity ctrl off]` with no console error. |

---

### 15.11 Firmware 2.0 – 2.14 additions (contract 2.0)

| ID | Requirement | How to verify |
|---|---|---|
| TR-49 | `api.php` accepts a log upload of **2 MB** (`GH_LOG_MAX_BYTES` ≥ 2 097 152, `post_max_size` above it). | POST a 1 048 618-byte body with a valid secret; expect 204 and the file stored. Repeat with 2 097 153 bytes; expect rejection. |
| TR-50 | The windows tile draws `PART_OPEN` as an open state, not with the `UNKNOWN` fill. | Feed `{"windows":{"M3":"PART_OPEN"}}`; the M3 rectangle's fill is the OPEN colour. |
| TR-51 | When `M3_percent_x10` is present, the M3 label shows the opening, clamped to 0–100 %. | Feed 252 → "25%"; feed 1137 → "100%"; omit the key → no percentage. |
| TR-52 | An unknown window state is drawn neutrally **with its raw text**. | Feed `"M3":"SOMETHING_NEW"`; the label contains `SOMETHING_NEW` and the fill is the neutral grey. |
| TR-53 | All sixteen `mode.flags[]` strings of §9.4 render as badges with the listed class and label. | Feed each flag alone; one badge each, class and text as in the table. |
| TR-54 | `bus` is read from the **top level**, and its absence is not an error. | Feed a payload with and without `bus`; no exception either way; with it, one row per entry. |
| TR-55 | The dashboard does not treat `heap_min_kb` as available memory. | Any heap indicator is driven by `heap_free_kb` / `heap_largest_kb`. |
| TR-56 | The M3 control-law keys are optional to render but never break the tile. | Feed `windows` with and without `M3_ctrl_mode`, `M3_ctrl_reason`, `M3_pos_gate`; the tile renders both. |
